Sokoban
=======

_2015-2017, Tobias KÃ¼ster_

Just my version of the classic Sokoban puzzle. Initially, this was just one among
many little entries in my `games` repository, but I like this one quite a bit (in
fact more than other, more professional versions of the game I've played so far)
and thus decided to move this to it's own repo and give it a bit more polish.

It has a super-minimalistic UI, but it can read arbitrary Sokoban level files and
keep a record of what level has been solved in how many moves. Also, it featurse
some amount of "planning", not only for finding the path to a certain location, 
but also for planning the "push-path" for moving a single crate to a new location.
This does not make the puzzles any easier, but it makes the game much less tedious
to play and more fun. Also features basic undo and snapshot-taking. Levels are not
included, but plenty can be found on the internet.

Features:
* load Sokoban levels in standard sokoban level file format
* save progress (solved/unsolved, number of turns) for each level in JSON file
* controls with arrow-keys or with mouse
* save/restore snapshot of current level, undo/redo-stack
* path-planning for movement and push-planning for pushing single boxes
